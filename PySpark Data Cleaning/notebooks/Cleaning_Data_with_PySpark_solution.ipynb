    "- This means that once a dataframe is created, you cannot change the contents of the dataframe, you can only create a new one.\n",
    "- We won't cover why during this class, beyond mentioning that it makes a distributed system (such as Spark) much more manageable.\n",
    "- While you cannot change a dataframe, you can create a new one.\n",
    "- Dataframes in Spark are defined with various types of *transformations*. These are the *lazy* commands we mentioned earlier. You can think of them as a recipe, or set of commands that will be run at a given time. \n",
    "- Spark *actions* (such as `.count()`, `.show()`, `.write()`, among others) instantiate the dataframe, meaning that the data is processed and available within the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to note is that these `.filter()` commands are not changing our underlying dataframe - it's creating a new dataframe with the results of the `.filter()` operation and giving us the `.count()` of that. This is all done behind the scenes for you, but it's important to understand what Spark is doing underneath.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Back to analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've determined there is a difference between the number of correct entries vs all entries (ie, take the full count and subtract the filtered dataframe), let's look at the rows that aren't coverting properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll do the same as before, but this time we're going to use the `.isNull()` method to obtain only the rows that can't be cast to integers. We'll use the `.show()` method to see the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note, this is only possible because Spark maintains an immutable dataframe. In our previous step, we created a new dataframe from our `.filter()` command, ran an action, and then Spark threw away the dataframe as we didn't assign it to a variable. We're going to now do the same type of operation on the original `titles_df` dataframe.*"

The separator cannot be an empty string so depending on your data, you may need to determine a character that is not used. For our purposes, let's use a curly brace, `{`, which is most likely not present in our data."
